# Authentication Implementation for CRUD Operations

## Overview

The CRUD functionality has been updated to require authentication. All API key operations are now user-specific, meaning users can only access, create, update, and delete their own API keys.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Authentication Flow

- **NextAuth.js** is used for authentication with Google OAuth
- User sessions are managed via JWT tokens
- User data is stored in the `users` table in Supabase
- API keys are linked to users via the `user_id` column

### 2. Database Schema Changes

The `api_keys` table now includes a `user_id` column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE api_keys ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

**Note**: The `users` table uses UUID for the `id` column, so `user_id` must also be UUID type.

### 3. API Endpoints Security

All API endpoints now require authentication:

- **GET `/api/keys`** - Returns only API keys belonging to the authenticated user
- **POST `/api/keys`** - Creates API keys for the authenticated user only
- **PUT `/api/keys/[id]`** - Updates API keys only if they belong to the authenticated user
- **DELETE `/api/keys/[id]`** - Deletes API keys only if they belong to the authenticated user

### 4. Authentication Utilities

Created `lib/auth.js` with utility functions:

- `getAuthenticatedUser()` - Gets the current user from the JWT token
- `requireAuth()` - Ensures authentication and returns user or error

### 5. Frontend Changes

The dashboards page now:

- Checks for authentication status
- Redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in page
- Handles 401 errors by redirecting to sign-in
- Shows loading states during authentication checks

## Setup Instructions

1. **Run the database migration** in your Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   -- See database_migration.sql for the complete migration
   ```

2. **Ensure environment variables** are set:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
   ```

3. **Test the authentication flow**:
   - Visit `/dashboards`
   - You should be redirected to sign-in if not authenticated
   - After signing in, you should see only your API keys

## Security Features

- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own API keys
- **Authentication Required**: All CRUD operations require valid authentication
- **Proper Error Handling**: 401 errors redirect to sign-in
- **Database Constraints**: Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- **Cascade Deletes**: When a user is deleted, their API keys are also deleted

## Error Handling

- **401 Unauthorized**: User is not authenticated or session expired
- **404 Not Found**: API key doesn't exist or doesn't belong to the user
- **409 Conflict**: Duplicate API key name for the same user
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database or server errors
